    Warp plugin by tem

    This plugin allows players to set a warp point and teleport to it
    (at cost of money, it can be changed in the config)

    Each player can only set one warp point at a time - and only for themselves.

    available commands:
    warp_place - sets a warp point
    warp_teleport - teleports to a warp point

    admin commands:
    warp_allow <name/part of name>- allows a player to set a warp point
    warp_disallow <name/part of name> - disallows a player to set a warp point
